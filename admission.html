	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admission to Class VI of the JNVs requires qualification in the (JNVST), an entrance exam designed, developed and conducted by the CBSE. JNVST for Class VI is conducted annually throughout the country to select the 80 most meritorious students for each JNV. It is conducted in three phases per year, depending upon the session structure in the specific state or union territory.Candidates can apply for the test only once during their Class V. Competition in the entrance exam can be gauged from fact that in JNVST 2015, a total of 1,878.15 thousand students appeared and 41.48 thousand students were selected (i.e. approx 2% pass percentage) The test encompasses mental ability skills, mathematics, and regional language. The schools provide reservation as per NVS policy which encompasses reservation for ST and SC (but not OBC), at least 75% selection of students from rural areas, maximum 25% from urban areas, fixed 33% for female students and 3% for disabled candidates.

To compensate for attrition and optimally utilize seats, JNVST, developed by CBSE, is also conducted for a admission to Class IX and lateral admissions, based on merit in Class X, are made for Class XI.
JNVs have classes from VI to XII standard. A particular JNV usually provides two streams among Science, Arts and Commerce for Class XI and XII. JNVs are known for their academic excellence,which can be attributed to their merit-based entrance test and unique climate provided for otherwise disadvantaged children,[18] and which is further proven by their performance at board examinations. More than half of JNVs have been equipped with smart classes. These schools regularly organize science congress and exhibitions to promote a research mindset.</p>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admission is done through competition test known as JNVST conducted by CBSE and Students are admitted in class VIth. The test consists of the objective questions on reasoning, mathematics and language. It is logically non-verbal and objective in nature and designed so that rural talented students are able to compete without suffering any disadvantage.
 
In order to optionally utilize infrastructure facilities, available vacant seats at class IXth level are filled by selection test on the basis of class VIIIth syllabus. Medium of test is Hindi /English as per choice of applicants. Vacant seats of class XIth are filled on the basis of class Xth merit.
 
As per scheme maximum of 80 students are admitted in class VIth every year.NVs has consistently produced the best results in CBSE board examinations over the years. In 2015–16 results, JNVs had a pass percentage of, 98.87% in Class X board exams and 96.73% in Class XII board exams.

Various activities under this include: Children Science Congress, Participation in multiple academic contests/Challenges/Olympiads, visit to Research Institutes, Tinkering Labs in schools, Environmental activities, Arranging International exposure to students, Enriched ICT support and Entrepreneurial skill trainings.

The annual Science Congress is organized annually in collaboration with research institutes and institutes of national importance at regional level. Exhibitions are organized at school, cluster, regional and national level for physics, chemistry Biology and maths.

Smart classes
Navodaya Vidyalayas in collaboration with Samsung India set up smart classes in 450 JNVs and 7 Navodaya Leadership Institutes from 2013 to 2019.A smart class is typically equipped with an interactive Smartboard, laptops/tablets, Wi-Fi connectivity and power backup. A smart class supplements regular lessons in mathematics, science social science, English, and Hindi to explain concepts in an engaging and interactive manner. Teachers are trained to use the equipment effectively.One of the important features of the JNV scheme is the Migration Programme wherein two linked JNVs of different linguistic categories exchange students between them.The aim of the exchange program is to "promote national integration and enrich social content". According to the scheme, a selected 30% of Class IX students are exchanged between two linked JNVs of different linguistic categories (generally between Hindi-speaking and non-Hindi-speaking states) for one year. During the migration period the three languages being taught to migrated students remain the same as in their parent JNV, but social and cultural exchanges are facilitated by their language learning in Class VI to IX. Initially migration was envisaged for students from Class IX to Class XII; it was reduced to two years (Class IX and Class X) in 1991–92. Finally in 1996-97 it was confined to only Class IX students.
