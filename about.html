	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) are a system of central schools for talented students predominantly from rural area in India. They are run by Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti, New Delhi, an autonomous organization under the Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Education (MoE), Government of India. JNVs are fully residential and co-educational schools affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), New Delhi, with classes from VI to XII standard.

JNVs are specifically tasked with finding talented children in rural areas of India and providing them with an education equivalent to the best residential school system, without regard to their families' socio-economic condition.

The Budget for Education, Boarding and activities at JNVs are provided by Ministry of Education, Government of India and it's free of cost for the students during the 7 years of stay.

JNVs exist all over India, with the exception of Tamil Nadu. There are approximately 661 across India as of 2016-17 academic year. As of 30 September 2019, a total of 636 JNVs are functional in the country with about 2,65,574 students enrolled, and out of which 2,06,728 (~78%) are from rural areas. In 2019, JNVs were the top-ranked C.B.S.E. schools, having a pass percentage of 98.57% and 96.62% in 10th and 12th grades respectively.

<p>
The idea of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas conceived by former Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi. The concept of opening a JNV in every district of India was born as a part of the National Policy on Education, 1986 with an aim of providing excellence coupled with social justice. Subsequently, Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) was registered as a society under the Societies Registration Act, 1860.

As per policy of the government, one JNV was to be established in each district of country. To start with, two Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas were established during 1985–86, at Jhajjar (Haryana) and Amravati (Maharashtra).[8] As of the 2015–16 academic session, JNVs had been sanctioned for 576 districts. In addition, ten JNVs have been sanctioned in districts having a large population of ST population, ten in districts having a large concentration of SC population and two special JNVs in Manipur, bringing the total number of sanctioned JNVs to 598.Out of these 591 JNVs are functional. In November 2016, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the opening of one JNV in each of the 62 uncovered districts. That will bring the total number of JNVs to 660 once operational.</p>
